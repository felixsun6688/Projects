                <div class="col-lg-12 history">
                	<p>
                    	Long, long ago, when the Maori of Aotearoa (New Zealand) first arrived, Ihenga the grandson of the great Pacific explorer Tamatekapu, discovered and named Lake Rotorua. Roto (meaning lake) and rua (meaning two) was named because it was the second one he discovered.  Mt Ngongotaha, the peak of which was known as Te Tuahu a te Atua (The Altar of the God) was the chief home of the fairy people of this country.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    	The name of that tribe of Patu-paiarehe was Ngati-Rua. They were an iwi atua (a god-like race, a people of supernatural powers). In appearance some of them were very much like the Maori people of today; others resembled the pakeha race. They were fair-skinned and their hair was red or golden tinged. Some had black eyes, some blue like fair-skinned Europeans. Some of their women were very beautiful, very fair of complexion, with shining fair hair. The patu-pairehe were a peaceful people who avoided war.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    	'The Patu-paiarehe of Ngongotaha had no water supply close to their pa at the sacred Tuahu a te Atua. Women had to draw their supplies from a spring under the northern cliffs, near the side of the Kauae spur carrying their water back up the mountain in taha (gourd calabashes). And there it was, upon the slopes of the fairy mountain, Ihenga, on climbing the mountain, met Maia of the Patu-paiarehe, when he first explored these parts nearly twenty generations ago.
As he climbed he had to press his way through thick fern on the lower slopes of the mountain before he came to the forest. He toiled upward, and when he came near the top of the peak he came all suddenly on the home of the Patu-paiarehe. He asked for water, and a beautiful young woman called Maia gave him a drink out of a calabash. Hence the name which Ihenga afterwards gave to the mountain, a combination of the words ngongo, to drink—also the wooden mouth-piece of the drinking-vessel—and taha, a calabash. The fairy people pressed around him in great curiosity and he became alarmed, thinking perhaps that they might kill and eat him and he turned and broke through them and fled down the mountainside. The Patu-paiarehe tribe chased him, but he far outstripped all of them except Maia. She wished to catch the stranger and make him her husband. He knew now that the uncanny people were Patu-paiarehe and he knew also that if once the athletic fairy lady seized him and laid her spell upon him he would never see his Maori wife again.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    	Just then, he thought of something to help him escape. He carried attached to his girdle a small putea or satchel, containing some kokowai, red ochre mixed with shark oil, which he used on occasions for painting his body. He opened this as he ran and smeared himself with it. Now, the fairy folk are very dainty and rhe haunga or odour of the shark-oil so disgusted the young woman that she stopped and gave up the chase. Ihenga rejoined his wife on the beach of the lake and told of his strange adventure.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    	Some time later, Ihenga became friendly with the Patu-paiarehe and dwelt quite near to them in his pa Whakaeke-tahuna, on the Waiteti stream, near the northern base of the fairy mountain.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    	Today, when you drink the pure, clean waters of Aorangi Peak, you know that you are also drinking from the springs of the ancient fairy people which has been brought to the surface at great effort by Aorangi Peak….
